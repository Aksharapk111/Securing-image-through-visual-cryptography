# Securing-image-through-visual-cryptography
Encrypting image using XOR based symmetric key encryption algorithm and facial image detection
The encryption and decryption is done by the XOR based Symmetric key algorithm in visual cryptography
The Face recognition is done by using the face recognition algorithm in dlib library
The environment used here is Visual Studio code and Spyder
Also implemented a user interface to enter the input
The front end is HTML and CSS
